Android app developed in conjunction with OpenCV and Pebble hardware to allow users to detect cars behind them from bikes. programmed in Eclipse
The  amount  of  deaths  caused  by  drivers  getting  into  an  accident  with  bikers  is  increasing  every  year. Studies show that most drivers don’t notice bikers on the road and unaware drivers frequently collide with bikers.  Our solution to this issue is mounting a standard android phone to the rear of the bike with the camera facing  out.  The  android  app  utilizes  haar  cascades  and source files from  OpenCV  libraries  to detect cars. As the image of the car encompasses larger areas, the app recognizes this as an oncoming car and sends  alerts  to  the  biker’s  pebble  watch. This  project  utilizes  Python, C, Java  and  Android. With minimal latency period, many lives can be saved with this simple and lightweight solution.
